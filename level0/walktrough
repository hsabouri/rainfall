1. run the binary program without anything -> segfault
2. run it with something -> probably a "No!"

3. run gdb and type these commands to have a nicer gdb :

    $> gdb level0
    gdb> layout asm
    gdb> set step-mode on

4. Then add breakpoint to main and run :

    gdb> b main
    gdb> r

5. By exploring the asm code we can see a conditionnal jump :

    08048ed9 3d a7 01        CMP        EAX,0x1a7       # compares input with 0x1a7 (423) into %eax
    08048ede 75 78           JNZ        LAB_08048f58    # jumps somewhere if %eax == 0 

6. Tried to run the binary with argument = 423

7. Got a shell ! (Seen it in asm code previously)

    $ whoami
    level1
    $ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
    1fe8a524fa4bec01ca4ea2a869af2a02260d4a7d5fe7e7c24d8617e6dca12d3a

8. Well.. got it!
